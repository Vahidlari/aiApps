# Ragora Development Repository

This repository hosts the development of **Ragora**, an open-source RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) library for Python, along with examples and use cases demonstrating its capabilities.

## 🎯 What is Ragora?

Ragora is a framework for building RAG systems that connect language models to real, reliable knowledge. It provides clean, composable interfaces for managing knowledge bases, document retrieval, and grounding pipelines. The name blends "RAG" with the ancient Greek "Agora" — the public square where ideas were exchanged and refined.

**Key Features:**
- 📄 Specialized LaTeX document processing with equation preservation
- 🏗️ Clean three-layer architecture for flexibility
- 🔍 Multiple search modes: vector, keyword, and hybrid
- 🧩 Composable components for custom pipelines
- ⚡ Performance-optimized with batch processing and GPU support

## 🚀 Quick Start

### For Users

Install Ragora from PyPI:

```bash
pip install ragora
```

See the [Ragora README](ragora/README.md) for installation and usage guide.

### For Contributors

Set up the development environment:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/vahidlari/aiapps.git
cd aiapps

# Open in DevContainer (recommended)
code .
# Click "Reopen in Container" when prompted
```

See [docs/onboarding.md](docs/onboarding.md) for detailed setup instructions.

## 🐳 Development Environment

### Using DevContainer (Recommended)

The easiest way to get started:

1. Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
2. Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)
3. Open the repository in VS Code
4. Click "Reopen in Container"

The DevContainer includes:
- Python 3.11 with all development tools
- AI/ML libraries (PyTorch, Transformers, Sentence Transformers)
- Code quality tools (Black, Flake8, isort, pytest)
- Jupyter Lab for interactive development

See [docs/devcontainer.md](docs/devcontainer.md) for details.

### Docker Images

Pre-built Docker images are available from GitHub Container Registry. See [tools/docker/README.md](tools/docker/README.md) for building and managing images.

### Database Setup

Ragora uses Weaviate as its vector database. For users, download the pre-configured database server from releases:

```bash
# Download from GitHub releases
wget https://github.com/vahidlari/aiapps/releases/latest/download/ragora-database-server.tar.gz
tar -xzf ragora-database-server.tar.gz
cd ragora-database-server
./database-manager.sh start
```

**For contributors:** Use the database server from this repository:
```bash
cd tools/database_server
./database-manager.sh start
```

See [tools/database_server/README.md](tools/database_server/README.md) for details.

## 🧪 Running Examples

```bash
# Navigate to examples
cd examples

# Run LaTeX document loading
python latex_loading_example.py

# Run document retrieval
python latex_retriever_example.py
```

**Note:** Examples assume Weaviate is running at `http://localhost:8080`. If running in DevContainer with Weaviate on the host, update the URL to `http://host.docker.internal:8080`.

See [examples/README.md](examples/README.md) for detailed examples documentation.

## 🧪 Running Tests

```bash
# Navigate to Ragora package
cd ragora

# Run all tests
python -m pytest

# Run with coverage
python -m pytest --cov=ragora --cov-report=html

# Run specific test types
python -m pytest tests/unit/          # Unit tests
python -m pytest tests/integration/  # Integration tests
```

See [ragora/docs/testing.md](ragora/docs/testing.md) for testing guidelines.
