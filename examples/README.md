# AI Models Examples

This directory is for storing examples and implementations of AI models and RAG systems.

## Directory Structure

```
examples/
├── models/           # AI model implementations
├── rag/             # RAG system examples
├── notebooks/       # Jupyter notebooks for experimentation
└── README.md        # This file
```

## Getting Started

1. **Create your model implementations** in the `models/` directory
2. **Build RAG systems** in the `rag/` directory
3. **Experiment with notebooks** in the `notebooks/` directory

## Example Structure

### Models Directory
```
models/
├── text_classification/
├── sentiment_analysis/
├── image_classification/
└── language_models/
```

### RAG Directory
```
rag/
├── document_qa/
├── knowledge_base/
├── chat_with_docs/
└── vector_search/
```

### Notebooks Directory
```

├── model_experiments/
├── data_analysis/
└── tutorials/
```

## Best Practices

- Use descriptive directory and file names
- Include README files for each major component
- Document your models and their usage
- Include example data and configuration files
- Use the pre-configured development tools (black, flake8, isort)
