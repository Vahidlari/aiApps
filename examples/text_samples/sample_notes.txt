Plain Text Ingestion Notes
==========================

Ragora can now preprocess plain text (.txt) files using the same pipeline that
handles Markdown documents. The parser normalizes paragraphs and forwards the
content to the chunker so the knowledge base retains meaningful context.

- Plain text is ideal for quick notes or exported transcripts.
- Chunk metadata includes the source file name for traceability.
- You can mix plain text with Markdown and LaTeX inside the same collection.

End of notes.
